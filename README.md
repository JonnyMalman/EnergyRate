The <b>ENTSO-e Energy Rate</b> QuickApp give you the current and coming energy spot price rates by hour from <a href="https://transparency.entsoe.eu/">ENTSO-e transparency platform</a> in your local currency. ENTSO-e is independent from any power company and no subscription or specific hardware is required to get this to work.
<i><h5>(*Local currency now reqires a free account at https://exchangerate.host)</h5></i>

<b><h1>How it works</h1></b>

After you have add this QA in FIBARO devices, you need to set your local energy area that you belong to in the general variables <b>[EnergyArea]</b> to start collecting energy prices.

The variation of energy hour level in <b>[EnergyHourLevel]</b> is calculated from price values you set in the QA local variables <b>[PriceLow], [PriceMedium], [PriceHigh], [PriceVeryHigh]</b>. You set those prices from what you feel is the correct level prices for you in your local currency* by consumed kWh.

<h4>(*If you use other than â‚¬ Euro as your local currency, you need to get your own free "API access key". See "Exchange rate in local currency" below for more information.)</h4>

<br>

Global variables to use in scenes:
<b>[EnergyCurrentRate]</b> show current energy rate price in selected currency.
<b>[EnergyHourLevel]</b> show what price level it is current hour.
<b>[EnergyNextHourLevel]</b> show what price level it will be the next hour.
<b>[EnergyMonthLevel]</b> show what the avrage price is in current month.

To calculate different energy prices including tax, costs, grid, fee, etc, you change these values in the local QA variables.
<h4>(EnergyRate * ExchangeRate + OperatorCost * Losses * Adjustment + DealerCost + GridCost * Tax)</h4>

- VeryLOW
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
- VeryHIGH

Usage in Lua scen:
```lua
local value = hub.getGlobalVariable("EnergyHourLevel")
if (value == "VeryHIGH") then
...
end
```

Or in Block scen:

The <b>ENTSO-e Energy Rate</b> QuickApp also store spot prices in the FIBARO Energy Tariff table.
You set how many days to store history in FIBARO tariff table in the QA variable <b>[TariffHistory]</b>.

```lua
-- How to get FIBARO Energy Tariff data
local tariffData = api.get("/energy/billing/tariff")
local currentRate = tariffData.rate
local tariffTable = tariffData.additionalTariffs
...

-- How to get Global QA Tariff state data
local tariffTable = {}
local jsonString = fibaro.getGlobalVariable("EnergyStateTable")
-- Decode json string to Lua table
if (jsonString ~= nil and jsonString ~= "") then 
    tariffTable = json.decode(jsonString)
end
...

```
